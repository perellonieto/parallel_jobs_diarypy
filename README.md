# parallel_jobs_diarypy
Example on how I run parallel jobs in a server with Tmux and DiaryPy

## Virtual environment

Create a virtual environment and install the depencencies

## Run all in parallel

There is a script that runs a specific number of processes with different
arguments with an upper limit of how many process concurrent can be run

## Results

Each execution will save the results in its own folder including a file with
the standard input, standard output and all logging messages
